### <a name="GAS-1"></a>[GAS-1] For Operations that will not overflow, you could use unchecked

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

12:         number++;

```

### <a name="GAS-2"></a>[GAS-2] `++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1` (same for `--i` vs `i--` or `i -= 1`)
Pre-increments and pre-decrements are cheaper.

For a `uint256 i` variable, the following is true with the Optimizer enabled at 10k:

**Increment:**

- `i += 1` is the most expensive form
- `i++` costs 6 gas less than `i += 1`
- `++i` costs 5 gas less than `i++` (11 gas less than `i += 1`)

**Decrement:**

- `i -= 1` is the most expensive form
- `i--` costs 11 gas less than `i -= 1`
- `--i` costs 5 gas less than `i--` (16 gas less than `i -= 1`)

Note that post-increments (or post-decrements) return the old value before incrementing or decrementing, hence the name *post-increment*:

```solidity
uint i = 1;  
uint j = 2;
require(j == i++, "This will be false as i is incremented after the comparison");
```
  
However, pre-increments (or pre-decrements) return the new value:
  
```solidity
uint i = 1;  
uint j = 2;
require(j == ++i, "This will be true as i is incremented before the comparison");
```

In the pre-increment case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`.

Consider using pre-increments and pre-decrements where they are relevant (meaning: not where post-increments/decrements logic are relevant).

## Non Critical Issues

| [NC-1](#NC-1) | Lack of checks in setters | 1 |
| [NC-2](#NC-2) | Missing Event for critical parameters change | 1 |
| [NC-3](#NC-3) | NatSpec is completely non-existent on functions that should have them | 2 |

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] Lack of checks in setters
Be it sanity checks (like checks against `0`-values) or initial setting checks: it's best for Setter functions to have them

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

7:     function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
           number = newNumber;

```

### <a name="NC-2"></a>[NC-2] Missing Event for critical parameters change
Events help non-contract tools to track changes, and events prevent users from being surprised by changes.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

7:     function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
           number = newNumber;

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] NatSpec is completely non-existent on functions that should have them
Public and external functions that aren't view or pure should have NatSpec comments

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

7:     function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {

11:     function increment() public {

```

### <a name="NC-4"></a>[NC-4] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

*Instances (2)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

7:     function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {

11:     function increment() public {

```

| [L-1](#L-1) | Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0` | 1 |

### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] File allows a version of solidity that is susceptible to an assembly optimizer bug
In solidity versions 0.8.13 and 0.8.14, there is an [optimizer bug](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/blob/499ab8abc19391be7b7b34f88953a067029a5b45/_posts/2022-06-15-inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug.md) where, if the use of a variable is in a separate `assembly` block from the block in which it was stored, the `mstore` operation is optimized out, leading to uninitialized memory. The code currently does not have such a pattern of execution, but it does use `mstore`s in `assembly` blocks, so it is a risk for future changes. The affected solidity versions should be avoided if at all possible.
